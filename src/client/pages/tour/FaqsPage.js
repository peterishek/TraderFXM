                      We may collect two types of data and information from our
                      Users. The first type of information is un-identified and
                      non-identifiable information pertaining to you, which may
                      be made available or gathered via your use of the Services
                      (“Non-personal Information“). We are not aware of the
                      identity from which the Non-personal Information is
                      collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may
                      include your aggregated usage information and technical
                      information transmitted by your device, including certain
                      software and hardware information about your device (e.g.,
                      the device you use, the type of browser and operating
                      system your device uses, language preference, access time
                      and the website’s domain name from which you linked to the
                      Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of
                      the Services. We may also collect information about your
                      activity on the Services (e.g., pages viewed, online
                      browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps, etc.). The second
                      type of information is individually identifiable
                      information, namely information that identifies an
                      individual or may with reasonable effort identify an
                      individual (“Personal Information“). Such information may

                      Account Information: When you sign-up and register to the

                      about yourself. You may register to the Services through
                      our website.

                      Registering through the our website: When you register to
                      the Services through the Application or our website, we
                      may collect from you the following information: full name,
                      email address, home address, hometown, nationality,
                      birthdate, phone number, as well as information required
                      for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer
                      requirements, such as passport or other identification
                      number, and any other information you agreed to share with
                      us.

                    <p>
                      Voluntarily Information: We may collect information which
                      you provide us voluntarily. For instance, when you respond
                      to communications from us, communicate with us via email
                      or share additional information about yourself through
                      your use of the Services. We may also collect the
                      feedback, suggestions, complaints and reports which you
                      send to us. Please note that we may also collect
                      complaints about you from other Users, which may include
                      your Personal Information.

                    <p>
                      For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal
                      Information with Non-personal Information, the combined
                      information will be treated as Personal Information as
                      long as it remains combined.

                      through the Services, including when you visit our

                      website assign to your device while you are viewing a
                      website. Cookies are very helpful and may be used for

                      other things, allowing you to navigate between pages
                      efficiently, enabling automatic activation of certain
                      features, remembering your preferences and making the
                      interaction between you and the Services quicker, easier
                      and smoother. Our website may use the following types of

                    <p>
                      Session Cookies which are stored only temporarily during a
                      browsing session in order to allow normal use of the
                      system and are deleted from your device when the browser
                      is closed.

                    <p>
                      Persistent Cookies which are saved on your device for a
                      fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is
                      closed. Such cookies are used where we need to identify
                      who you are for repeated visits (for instance, to allow us
                      to store your preferences for the next sign-in).

                    <p>
                      Third-Party Cookies which are set by other online services
                      that run content on the page you view on your browser (for
                      example, by third-party advertising companies who monitor

                      You may remove the cookies by following the instructions

                      disable cookies, some features of the Services may not
                      operate properly and your online experience may be
                      limited. We also use a tool called Google Analytics to
                      collect information about your use of the Services. Google
                      Analytics collects information such as how often users
                      access the Services, what pages they visit when they do
                      so, etc. We use the information we get from Google
                      Analytics only to improve our Services. Google Analytics
                      collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you
                      visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying
                      information. We do not combine the information collected
                      through the use of Google Analytics with personally
                      identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and
                      share information collected by Google Analytics about your
                      visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics

                      The Google Advertising ID is an anonymous identifier,
                      provided by Google Play services. If your device has an
                      Advertising ID, we may collect and use it for advertising
                      and user analytics purposes. We may also use Apple’s
                      Advertising Identifier (IDFA), which is a non-permanent
                      device identifier provided by Apple, and any information
                      obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier,

                      Application or using the Services you explicitly agree
                      that we may associate your Advertising ID and your
                      Advertising Identifier with your applicable persistent
                      device identifier. This will facilitate our ability to
                      improve your personalized experience. Further, we may use
                      other persistent identifiers for non-advertising purposes.
                      If your device does not have Advertising ID or Advertising
